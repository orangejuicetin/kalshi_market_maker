# Project TAJIR - a market maker for [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)

Started in my time at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/about) and a wonderful way to get in the weeds concerning markets, orderbooks, and figuring out how to navigate the treacherous, low-liquidity/volume terrain that is an early stage market. 

Built simply and entirely in Python, meant to be lightweight so as to run on a Droplet and not need too much computational strain. Reach out to me if you ever want to chat concerning it!
